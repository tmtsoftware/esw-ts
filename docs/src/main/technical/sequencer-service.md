# Sequencer Service

This service provides a handle to send commands to a Sequencer which is registered in Location Service.

## Creation of Sequencer Service

### Pre-requisite

### In order to use sequencer service client for a specific sequencer

  1. The Sequencer and Gateway Server should be running.
    `GatewayException(InvalidComponent)` will be thrown if the specified sequencer not found in the Location Service.
  2. Authorization token with correct access role.
     Documentation on how to fetch access token could be found @ref[here](../aas/auth-components.md).

### Loading and Starting a Sequence into a Sequencer

To load a sequence into a Sequencer, `SequencerService` provides `loadSequence` method
which takes a `Sequence` and returns a `Promise<OkOrUnhandledResponse>`.
If Sequencer is in `Idle` state, provided sequence gets loaded into the Sequencer and an `Ok` response gets returned.
Otherwise, an `Unhandled` response gets returned.

To start a loaded sequence, `SequencerService` provides `startSequence` method
which starts the sequence (which is loaded by `loadSequence` method) in the Sequencer
and returns a `Promise<SubmitResponse>`.
If Sequencer is in `Loaded` state, loaded sequence's execution gets started in the Sequencer
and a `Started` response gets returned. Otherwise, a negative SubmitResponse gets returned.

### Adding commands into the sequence after all the pending steps

To add commands into the sequence after all the pending steps, `SequencerService` provides `add` method

and a `Ok` response gets returned. Otherwise, an `Unhandled` response gets returned.

### Submitting Sequence to a Sequencer

To submit a Sequence to a Sequencer, `SequencerCommandService` provides a `submit` method which takes a Sequence and returns a
`Promise<SubmitResponse>`.

If the Sequencer is idle, then provided sequence gets loaded in the Sequencer,
execution of the sequence starts immediately and a `Started` response gets returned.
If the sequencer is already running another sequence, then an `Invalid` response gets returned.

Typescript
: @@snip [submit](../../../../example/src/documentation/sequencer/SequencerExamples.ts) { #submit }

The `query` or `queryFinal` methods, as shown above, could be used to query for the sequence result after the sequence is `submit`ted.
The `query` method returns a current response which could be either final response (eg. `Completed`) or intermediate response (eg. `Started`).
Whereas `queryFinal` will wait for the final response of the sequence for the given `timeout`. This method will never return an intermediate response.

If you are not interested in initial/intermediate response but only in final response, you can use the `submitAndWait` method which submits
the sequence and waits for the final response (if the sequence was successfully `Started`).

To subscribe to state of Sequencer, `subscribeSequencerState` method can be used. This method invokes the given `callback` on every state change with newly received `SequencerStateResponse`.
`SequencerStateResponse` contains the current `SequencerState` and `StepList`. This method returns a `Subscription` which can be used to unsubscribe, as shown in example.
